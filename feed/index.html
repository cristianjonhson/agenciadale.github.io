								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn&#8217;t methodical, but jazz isn&#8217;t messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians. If you want to be a rock star or just be famous, then run down the street naked, you&#8217;ll make the news or something. But if you want music to be your livelihood, then play, play, play and play! And eventually you&#8217;ll get to where you want to be. </p>

<p>Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn&#8217;t know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about. Jazz is smooth and cool. Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn&#8217;t methodical, but jazz isn&#8217;t messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians.</p>

<p>The bank manager long ago won the battle for the heart of the Stones – surveying the baffling number of hospitality packages and “tiers” of general admission at Hyde Park, one can’t help but feel sorry for the poor fan who just wanted a ticket for the gig. But all one’s scepticism disappears the minute the riff of Start Me Up explodes out of the speakers, an awful lot more sure-footed than it sounded on the TV from Glastonbury.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Tea</li>

</ul>
<p>And while a sizeable section of today’s audience weren’t even born the last time Mick and co ambled through Midnight Rambler here, the fact that they’d turned out in their thousands to tread in their parents’ sandal-steps speaks volumes about the band’s enduring appeal. Things got off to a less than auspicious start. Keith Richards fluffed not one, but two of opener Start Me Up’s opening three chords – a riff one suspects, given the number of times he’s played it, would be harder for him to play wrong than right.</p>

<h2>Blockquotes</h2>
<p>Single line blockquote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s still a strange jukebox anonymity to the Keys&#8217; approach; their vintage organ and guitar sounds often project larger personae than the band itself. But part of the reason Carney and Auerbach keep finding new ways to shake up that old-school blues-rock rumble is that they&#8217;re workaday dudes smart enough to get out of the way of their own songs. Like Clark Kent&#8217;s or Peter Parker&#8217;s, their 99 percentness only seems to enhance their powers.<br />
Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:</p>
<blockquote><p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&#8217;ve got to focus on. But that&#8217;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&#8217;m actually as proud of the things we haven&#8217;t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. <cite>Steve Jobs &#8211; Apple Worldwide Developers&#8217; Conference, 1997</cite></p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I&#8217;ll have sections that I&#8217;m not quite sure how they fit in the puzzle of a tune, they&#8217;ll get moved around; what I think was originally a verse ends up becoming the chorus, or what&#8217;s an intro gets dropped as a hook, things get shifted around a lot. Feelings aroused by the touch of someone&#8217;s hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith &#8211; all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well. </p>
<p>Inspiration comes from so many sources. Music, other fiction, the non-fiction I read, TV shows, films, news reports, people I know, stories I hear, misheard words or lyrics, dreams&#8230; Motivation? The memory of the rush I get from a really good writing session &#8211; even on a bad day, I know I&#8217;ll find that again if I keep going.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think music is so diverse today, and bands are so diverse. If you were a rock band in the Eighties, you kind of had to stick to one thing. Now, in this age of Coachella and European festivals and stuff, it&#8217;s kind of anything goes, so that allowed us to try different things. </p></blockquote>
<p>When you make music, you&#8217;re forming these invisible vibrations in the air into different shapes and consistencies and speeds in order to create music, and understanding how the math of that works just gives you more colors to paint with, and allows you to get to what you want quicker. </p>
<p>Sometimes I&#8217;ll have sections that I&#8217;m not quite sure how they fit in the puzzle of a tune, they&#8217;ll get moved around; what I think was originally a verse ends up becoming the chorus, or what&#8217;s an intro gets dropped as a hook, things get shifted around a lot. Feelings aroused by the touch of someone&#8217;s hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith &#8211; all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well. </p>

If you want to be a rock star or just be famous, then run down the street naked, you&#8217;ll make the news or something. But if you want music to be your livelihood, then play, play, play and play! And eventually you&#8217;ll get to where you want to be. </p>
<blockquote><p>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn&#8217;t know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about. Jazz is smooth and cool. Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn&#8217;t methodical, but jazz isn&#8217;t messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I&#8217;ll have sections that I&#8217;m not quite sure how they fit in the puzzle of a tune, they&#8217;ll get moved around; what I think was originally a verse ends up becoming the chorus, or what&#8217;s an intro gets dropped as a hook, things get shifted around a lot. Feelings aroused by the touch of someone&#8217;s hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith &#8211; all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well.</p>
<p>Inspiration comes from so many sources. Music, other fiction, the non-fiction I read, TV shows, films, news reports, people I know, stories I hear, misheard words or lyrics, dreams&#8230; Motivation? The memory of the rush I get from a really good writing session &#8211; even on a bad day, I know I&#8217;ll find that again if I keep going.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think music is so diverse today, and bands are so diverse. If you were a rock band in the Eighties, you kind of had to stick to one thing. Now, in this age of Coachella and European festivals and stuff, it&#8217;s kind of anything goes, so that allowed us to try different things.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you make music, you&#8217;re forming these invisible vibrations in the air into different shapes and consistencies and speeds in order to create music, and understanding how the math of that works just gives you more colors to paint with, and allows you to get to what you want quicker.</p>
